Updates:
- templates added to divide the map
    divides the sky in regions given latitudes (symmetrically), optimizing the following evaluation
- Added module to analyse the validity of the result, comparing with the PLA CMB simulation. This includes:
    · TT-plot (fit y = ax + b)
    · Reminder analysis ([output map] - [PLA CMB map]

Remainig problems:
- Unit converter from density flux to T does not work propperly, revise Rayleigh-Jeans

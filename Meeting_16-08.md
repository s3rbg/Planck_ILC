 - Negative temperatures: data is fluctuation map with respect to CMB, so the mean temperature (2.7K) is fixed at zero and the pixel meassures the deviation from it
 - Maps are plotted in logarithmic scale, use hist option in norm when plotting with healpy mollview
 - A good crosscheck for the units is to compare the observational data with the components simulation

Updates:

-Added module to compute the weights from the covariance matrix
-Tests with higher frequencies simulations, mixing temperature and flux units
-Added conversion from MJy/sr to K


Achieved:
-With low frecs, stdev goes from 750 uK down to 250 uK. CMB simulation has an stdev of 97 uK

Pending:
- Revise if plot correctly (try working with energies rather than temperature)
- Apply the method in sections
- Revise the output files, there may be some mixing between high and low freqs

Problems:
- Negative values in data???
- Working with high freq, covariance is singular matrix (has sth to do with units?)
